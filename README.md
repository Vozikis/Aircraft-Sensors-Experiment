# Aircraft-Sensors-Experiment


The project "From Black-Box Models to Actionable Insights" attempts to merge SHAP values with LLMs, giving better interpretability for decision-making features in predictive maintenance. Using LLMs, the system can now enable the transformation of technical outputs from black-box models into human-readable, actionable insights for operators in high-stakes environments such as aircraft engine maintenance. This ranges from multivariate sensor data analysis via modeling using RNNs, LSTMs, and transformers to the usage of SHAP values explaining model predictions. With such explanations, LLMs give clear guidance that provides concrete steps that can be performed to avoid or remedy the detected malfunction.
